This research proposes two mechanisms to improve the field of prescription measurement using multi-modal radars. The first is a method of fusing two dual-polarization radars operating at different frequencies in order to produce a single DSD estimate that does not require assumption of distribution parameters. The proposed DSD is then used to create a QPE that is validated experimentally using a network of precipitation measurement sites.
    
The estimated DSD will then be used to train an unsupervised neural network and evolutionary computing AI model that can be deployed on the GPM to estimate precipitation across the globe more accurately then can be estimated using traditional analytical methods with a dual frequency radar.
